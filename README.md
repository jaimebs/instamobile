Study project in React Native.

## Getting Started

First clone the project, then run npm install, then run react-native run-android / ios.

## Commands React-native

- react-native run android (To run Android)
- react-native run ios (To run Ios)
- react-native start --reset-cache (To clear the cache)

### Frameworks used

> axios

Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Requests rest.

> react-navigation

React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript (so you can read and understand all of the source), on top of powerful native primitives.

> react-native-gesture-handler

Gesture Handler aims to replace React Native's built in touch system called Gesture Responder System.
Obs: Run react-native link react-native-gesture-handler

> react-native-image-picker

Allows you to use native UI to select a photo/video from the device library or directly from the camera.
Obs: Run react-native link react-native-image-picker. _Then go to the installation documentation_: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-image-picker/blob/master/docs/Install.md

> socket.io-client

A standalone build of socket.io-client is exposed automatically by the socket.io server. Real-time changes.
